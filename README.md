## **Project Description**
This is a demonstration of VPN software and virtual machine use to observe what a VPN does in a real-world setting. I will walk through what a VPN is, how to install it, and why you need one. I will also use a virtual machine on Azure for this demonstration.

## **Project Summary**
- ### **ðŸ”¹ What is a VPN?** 
  A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that helps you protect your online privacy and secure your internet connection. It works by creating an encrypted tunnel between your device (like your computer, smartphone, or tablet) and the internet.
  
- ### **ðŸ”¹ Why use a VPN?** 
 A VPN hides where you're browsing from and scrambles your online activity, keeping it private and safe, especially on public Wi-Fi. It helps you watch shows or access websites from other countries that might be blocked. It also stops internet providers from slowing down your connection and lets you safely connect to work from anywhere.
- ### **ðŸ”¹ Environments used in this demonstration** 
  Microsoft Azure, Windows 10.

  ## **Technologies Used**

- **Proton VPN**
- **Azure Virtual Machine**
- **Azure Resource Group**

## **Setup & Installation Demonstration**
Log into Microsoft Azure and create a resource group and a virtual machine.

Browse to [www.whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) on your personal computer, and observe your IP address.

Next, on your personal computer, set up an account with Proton VPN using the free account. (Write all this down!)

Once your account is created, go to your virtual machine. 

Inside your VM, browse to whatismyipaddres.com again and take a look at your virtual machine's IP address, and write it down.

Next, install Proton VPN on your virtual machine, and start running the free version. Pick the free VPN option on the program. It will then change your VM's IP address to a different country.

Keep in mind, that if you are using the free version, only the USA VPN option is available. If you are already in the US like me, your country won't change, but your IP address will.

Go back to whatismyIPaddress.com and then observe your virtual machine's new IP address.

All done! You have successfully used a VPN and changed your IP and region. Keep in mind, you don't have to use virtual machines to do this. You can just use your home computer and change it's IP address, but for the sake of demonstration, I used one.
